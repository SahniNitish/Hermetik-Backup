N# APY Calculation System - Business Report
**For CEO Review**  
*Date: August 20, 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive APY (Annual Percentage Yield) calculation system that provides real-time portfolio performance metrics for our users. This system automatically calculates and displays the annualized returns for each investment position, giving users clear visibility into their DeFi portfolio performance.

**Key Achievement**: Users can now see their actual APY returns in real-time, with confidence levels indicating the reliability of each calculation.

## What is APY and Why It Matters

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield)** is the annualized return rate that shows how much an investment is earning over a year. For example:
- If you invest $10,000 and earn $1,000 in a year, your APY is 10%
- If you earn $500 in 6 months, your APY would be 10% (annualized)

**Business Value**: APY helps users understand their portfolio performance at a glance, making informed investment decisions and comparing different DeFi protocols.

## How Our APY System Works

### 1. Data Collection
Our system automatically collects daily snapshots of user portfolios from DeBank, including:
- **Supply Tokens**: The main tokens users have deposited (e.g., ETH, USDC)
- **Reward Tokens**: Tokens earned as rewards (e.g., CRV, UNI)
- **Position Values**: Total USD value of each investment position

### 2. Three Calculation Methods

#### Method A: New Positions (Most Common)
**When**: A user adds a new investment position
**How**: We calculate APY based on unclaimed rewards
**Example**:
- User invests $25,000 in Convex protocol
- After 1 day, they have $92.52 in unclaimed rewards
- APY = ($92.52 ÷ $25,000) × 365 days = **134.60%**
- **Confidence**: Medium (estimated based on 1-day rewards)

#### Method B: Existing Positions with Stable Value
**When**: Position value hasn't changed much but has accumulated rewards
**How**: We use accumulated rewards over a reasonable time period
**Example**:
- Position value: $20,000 (unchanged)
- Unclaimed rewards: $150 (accumulated over 15 days)
- APY = ($150 ÷ ($20,000 × 15 days)) × 365 = **18.25%**
- **Confidence**: High (based on actual reward accumulation)

#### Method C: Value Change Analysis
**When**: Position value has changed significantly over time
**How**: We compare today's value with yesterday's value
**Example**:
- Yesterday: $10,000
- Today: $10,500 (5% increase in 1 day)
- APY = ((1 + 0.05) ^ (365 ÷ 1)) - 1 = **1,825%** (annualized)
- **Confidence**: High (based on actual value change)
